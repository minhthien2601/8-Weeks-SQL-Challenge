## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Solution - B. Transaction Analysis

***

**1. How many unique transactions were there?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) as Unique_trans
FROM sales;
```

**2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(qty) / COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) as average_unique_product 
FROM sales ;
```

**3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?**

```sql
WITH CTE AS ( 
            SELECT  DISTINCT txn_id,
                    SUM(qty * price) as total_revenue
            FROM sales
            GROUP BY txn_id
            )

SELECT  distinct PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25)  WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_revenue ) 
                            OVER () AS percentile_25 , 
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)  WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_revenue ) 
                            OVER () AS percentile_50,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75)  WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_revenue ) 
                            OVER () AS percentile_75                      
FROM CTE ;
```

**4. what is the average discount value per transaction?**

```sql
SELECT SUM(qty * price * (cast(discount as decimal(10,2)) /100) ) / COUNT (distinct txn_id) AS average_discount 
FROM sales ;

```

**5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?**

```sql
WITH CTE_member AS (SELECT distinct txn_id, 
                            member, 
                            CASE WHEN member = 1 then 1 
                                ELSE 0 END AS member_int
                    FROM sales)

SELECT CAST( 100* SUM(member_int) AS FLOAT)/COUNT (txn_id) AS perc_trans_mems,
        100 - CAST( 100* SUM(member_int) AS FLOAT)/COUNT (txn_id) as perc_trans_non_mems
FROM CTE_member ;
```

- The percentage of member's transactions is 60.2
- The percentage of non-member transactions is 39.8

**6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?**

```sql
WITH CTE_revenue AS (SELECT DISTINCT txn_id,
                            member,
                            SUM(qty * price) as revenue
                    FROM sales
                    GROUP BY txn_id,member )

SELECT  DISTINCT member ,  
        AVG(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY member) as average_revenue
FROM CTE_revenue
```

- The average revenue for member transactions is 516
- The average revenue for non-member transactions is 515
