Use a single SQL query to transform the `product_hierarchy` and `product_prices` datasets to the `product_details` table.

Hint: you may want to consider using a recursive CTE to solve this problem!

I did not use CTEs here, just consequent self joins on `parent_id` and `id` columns. The `product_name` column is generated by the `concat()` function.

```sql
SELECT  product_id,
        price,
        CONCAT(p.level_text, ' ', p1.level_text, ' - ', p2.level_text) AS product_name,
        p2.id AS category_id,
        p1.id AS segment_id,
        p.id AS style_id,
        p2.level_text AS category_name,
        p1.level_text AS segment_name,
        p.level_text AS style_name
FROM product_hierarchy AS p
JOIN product_hierarchy AS p1 on p.parent_id = p1.id
JOIN product_hierarchy AS p2 on p1.parent_id = p2.id
JOIN product_prices AS pp on p.id = pp.id
```
- In the First join - it filtered itself between parent_id and id to show the parent_id showing 2 types of category

- In the second join - to show the Category types and Segment types

- In the final join - to filter the product_id and price and selected relevant column
