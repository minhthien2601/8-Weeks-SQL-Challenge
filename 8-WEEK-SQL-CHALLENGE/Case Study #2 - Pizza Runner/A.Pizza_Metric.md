### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?
- Here we want the max number of pizzas `delivered` in a single order.
  - So we need a `WHERE` clause to filter only orders where `pickup_time IS NOT NULL` (order was not cancelled).
- Then we can use `SELECT TOP 1`, and `ORDER by the COUNT of pizza_id in DESCENDING order` (largest count first) to get the max count of pizzas delivered.

```sql
SELECT TOP 1 c.order_id, 
       COUNT(c.order_id) as number_order
FROM #customer_orders c 
RIGHT JOIN #runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation is NULL
GROUP BY c.order_id
ORDER BY number_order DESC;
```
#### Result

#
### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
- In this case, I use CTE, and CASE WHEN method to create a new column 'STATUS'  

```sql
WITH Status_table AS (
            SELECT order_id, 
                    customer_id,
                    pizza_id,
                    exclusions, 
                    extras, 
                    CASE WHEN exclusions is not null or extras is not null THEN 'CHANGE'
                      ELSE 'NOT CHANGE' END AS STATUS 
            FROM #customer_orders 
)
SELECT customer_id,
        STATUS, 
        COUNT(STATUS) as count
FROM Status_table s 
RIGHT JOIN #runner_orders r ON s.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.cancellation is NULL
GROUP BY customer_id,STATUS
ORDER BY customer_id

```

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
- This is when `both fields` in the exclusions and extras columns `are populated`, so not NULL .
- Again, we want delivered pizzas so we need the same WHERE clause as before.

```sql
SELECT count(c.order_id) as both_exclusions_extras
FROM #customer_orders c 
RIGHT JOIN #runner_orders r ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE exclusions is not null and extras is not null and r.cancellation is null
```
#### Results

#
### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?
- Here we can use `DATEPART` to `extract the HOUR from order_date`.
  - Using `DATENAME`would give us the same result.
    - The difference is DATEPART returns an intiger, while DATENAME returns a string.
  
```sql
SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, [order_time]) as hour_of_day, 
       COUNT (order_id) as pizza_count
FROM #customer_orders
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, [order_time])
```
#### Result

#
### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
- Here we can use `DATENAME` to `extract the WEEKDAY with their actual names (Monday, Tuesday...)` instead of numbers (1, 2...) from order_time.
  
```sql
SELECT DATENAME(WEEKDAY,[order_time]) as weekday, 
        COUNT (order_id) as pizza_count
FROM #customer_orders
GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY,[order_time]);

```
#### Result
