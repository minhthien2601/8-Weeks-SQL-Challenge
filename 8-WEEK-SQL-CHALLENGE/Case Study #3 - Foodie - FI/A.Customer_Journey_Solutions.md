## Question
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table (customer_id 1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19), write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
--> I created a subscriptions_demo version

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subscriptions_demo
CREATE TABLE subscriptions_demo (
  customer_id INTEGER,
  plan_id INTEGER,
  start_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO subscriptions_demo
  (customer_id, plan_id, start_date)
VALUES 
('1',	'0',	'2020-08-01'),
('1',	'1',	'2020-08-08'),
('2',	'0',	'2020-09-20'),
('2',	'3',	'2020-09-27'),
('11','0',	'2020-11-19'),
('11','4'	,'2020-11-26'),
('13','0',	'2020-12-15'),
('13','1'	,'2020-12-22'),
('13',	'2'	,'2021-03-29'),
('15',	'0'	,'2020-03-17'),
('15', '2'	,'2020-03-24'),
('15',	'4'	,'2020-04-29'),
('16',	'0'	,'2020-05-31'),
('16',	'1'	,'2020-06-07'),
('16',	'3'	,'2020-10-21'),
('18',	'0'	,'2020-07-06'),
('18',	'2'	,'2020-07-13'),
('19',	'0'	,'2020-06-22'),
('19',	'2'	,'2020-06-29'),
('19',	'3',	'2020-08-29');
```
#### SQL Query

- To see a customers jouney we want to SELECT the customer_id, the plan_name (to see the different plans they have subscribed to) and the start_date (to see when). 
- We can also add a column to show how long it took them to change, upgrade or cancel their subscription. 
  - For this we can use the `LAG()` Window Function:
  
    > `LAG()` let's you compare the current row to the previous row (or row above). It lets you access the value on the previous row from the current row. 

    - using  DATEDIFF(day,...) Between start_date & LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date):
      - start_date - LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) 
    - We can also add a column with the difference in MONTHS:
      - using  DATEDIFF(month,...) Between start_date & LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) 
      

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
       p.plan_name,
       s.start_date,
       DATEDIFF(day, LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date),start_date ) AS days_diff,
       DATEDIFF(month,LAG(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date),start_date) as months_diff
FROM   subscriptions_demo AS s
JOIN   plans AS p
ON     s.plan_id = p.plan_id
;
```
