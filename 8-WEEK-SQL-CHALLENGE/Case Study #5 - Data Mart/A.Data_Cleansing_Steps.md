# ðŸ›’ Case Study #5 - Data Mart
<p align="right"> Using Microsoft SQL Server </p>

## ðŸ§¼ Solution - A. Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:  

| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

**Answer:**

## Create New Table `clean_weekly_sales`

Let's construct the structure of `clean_weekly_sales` table and lay out the actions to be taken.

_`*` represent new columns_

| Columns | Actions to take |
| ------- | --------------- |
| week_date | Convert to `DATE` using `TO_DATE`
| week_number* | Extract number of week using `DATE_PART` 
| month_number* | Extract number of month using `DATE_PART` 
| calendar_year* | Extract year using `DATE_PART`
| region | No changes
| platform | No changes
| segment | No changes
| age_band* | Use `CASE WHEN` and based on `segment`, 1 = `Young Adults`, 2 = `Middle Aged`, 3/4 = `Retirees` and null = `Unknown`
| demographic* | Use `CASE WHEN` and based on `segment`, C = `Couples` and F = `Families` and null = `Unknown`
| transactions | No changes
| avg_transaction* | Divide `sales` with `transactions` and round up to 2 decimal places
| sales | No changes

**Answer:**

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;


SELECT CONVERT(date,week_date,3) as week_date,
        DATEPART(week,CONVERT(date,week_date,3)) as week_number, 
        DATEPART(month,CONVERT(date,week_date,3)) as month_number,
        DATEPART(year,CONVERT(date,week_date,3)) as calendar_year,
        CASE WHEN SUBSTRING(segment,2,1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults'
            WHEN SUBSTRING(segment,2,1) = '2' THEN  'Middle Aged'
            WHEN SUBSTRING(segment,2,1) = '3' or SUBSTRING(segment,1,1) = '4' THEN 'Retirees'

        cast (cast(sales as float)/transactions as decimal(10,2)) as avg_transaction 
INTO clean_weekly_sales
FROM weekly_sales;
