## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Solution - C. Campaigns Analysis

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)
  
**Solution**

Steps:
- We will merge multiple tables:
  - Using JOIN for `users` and `events` table
  - joining `event_identifier` table using LEFT JOIN to filter the event_name in SELECT
  - Joining `campaign_identifier` table using LEFT JOIN as we want all lines that have `event_time` between `start_date` and `end_date`. 
  - Joining `page_hierachy` table using LEFT JOIN as we want all the rows in the `page_hierachy` table
- To generate earliest `visit_start_time` for each unique `visit_id`, use `MIN()` to find the 1st `visit_time`. 
- Wrap `SUM()` with CASE statement in order to find the total number of counts for `page_views`, `cart_adds`, `purchase`, ad `impression` and ad `click`.
- To get a list of products added into cart sorted by sequence, 
-   Firstly, use a CASE statement to only get cart add events. 
-   Then, use `STRING_AGG()` to separate products by comma `,` and sort the sequence using `sequence_number WITHIN GROUP 

```sql
SELECT  user_id,
        visit_id,
        MIN(event_time) AS visit_start_time,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
        c.campaign_name,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click,
        STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN event_name = 'Add to Cart' AND p.product_id IS NOT NULL THEN page_name ELSE NULL END, ',' ) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY e.sequence_number)
FROM events e 
LEFT JOIN users u ON e.cookie_id = u.cookie_id
LEFT JOIN event_identifier e2 ON e.event_type = e2.event_type
LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier c ON e.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date and c.end_date
LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy p ON e.page_id = p.page_id
GROUP BY user_id,visit_id,c.campaign_name;
```
