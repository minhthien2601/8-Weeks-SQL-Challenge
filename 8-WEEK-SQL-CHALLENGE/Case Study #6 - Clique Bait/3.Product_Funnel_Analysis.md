## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Solution - B. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

1. How many times was each product viewed?
2. How many times was each product added to cart?
3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
4. How many times was each product purchased?

## Planning Our Strategy

Let us visualize the output table.

| Column | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| product | Name of the product |
| views | Number of views for each product |
| cart_adds | Number of cart adds for each product |
| abandoned | Number of times product was added to a cart, but not purchased |
| purchased | Number of times product was purchased |

These information would come from these 2 tables.
- `events` table - visit_id, page_id, event_type
- `page_hierarchy` table - page_id, product_category

**Solution**
- Note 1 - In first CTE, find all customer have done event 'Page View'
- Note 2 - In `VIEW_CTE` CTE, count all customer with event 'Page View'
- Note 3 - In `ADD_CART_CTE` CTE, count all customer with event 'Add to Cart'
- Note 4 - In `PURCHASE_CTE` and 'PURCHASE_CTE_2' CTE, count all customer with event 'Purchase'
- merge all CTE above using `LEFT JOIN`. 
```sql

WITH CTE AS (   SELECT distinct visit_id
                FROM events e1 
                JOIN event_identifier e2 ON e1.event_type = e2.event_type
                WHERE event_name = 'Page View'),

VIEW_CTE AS (   SELECT page_name,
                        product_category,
                        count(page_name) AS total_view
                        FROM events e1 
                        LEFT JOIN CTE c ON e1.visit_id = c.visit_id 
                        JOIN page_hierarchy p ON e1.page_id = p.page_id
                        JOIN event_identifier e2 ON e1.event_type = e2.event_type
                        WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL AND event_name = 'Page View' 
                        GROUP BY page_name,product_category),

ADD_CART_CTE AS (SELECT page_name,
                        product_category,
                        count(page_name) AS total_add
                        FROM events e1 
                        LEFT JOIN CTE c ON e1.visit_id = c.visit_id 
                        JOIN page_hierarchy p ON e1.page_id = p.page_id
                        JOIN event_identifier e2 ON e1.event_type = e2.event_type
                        WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL AND event_name = 'Add to Cart' 
                        GROUP BY page_name,product_category),

PURCHASE_CTE AS (SELECT visit_id
                FROM events e1 
                JOIN event_identifier e2 ON e1.event_type = e2.event_type
                WHERE event_name = 'Purchase'),
PURCHASE_CTE_2 AS (     SELECT  page_name,
                                product_category,
                                COUNT(e1.visit_id) as purchase_item
                        FROM events e1
                        RIGHT JOIN PURCHASE_CTE C on e1.visit_id = C.visit_id
                        JOIN page_hierarchy p ON e1.page_id = p.page_id
                        JOIN event_identifier e2 ON e1.event_type = e2.event_type
                        WHERE product_category IS NOT NULL AND event_name = 'Add to Cart'
                        GROUP BY page_name,product_category
                        )


SELECT v.page_name,
        v.product_category,
        total_view,
        total_add,
        purchase_item, 
        (total_add - purchase_item) as abadoned_item
INTO    product_stats
FROM VIEW_CTE V
LEFT JOIN ADD_CART_CTE A ON V.page_name = A.page_name
LEFT JOIN PURCHASE_CTE_2 P ON V.page_name = P.page_name
ORDER BY v.page_name;

SELECT * 
FROM product_stats;
```

The logic behind `abadoned_item` column is result of total_add minus purchase_item

***

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

**Solution**

```sql
SELECT product_category,
        SUM (total_view) AS total_view,
        SUM(total_add) as total_add,
        SUM(purchase_item) as total_purchase, 
        SUM(abadoned_item) as abadoned_item
FROM product_stats
GROUP BY product_category;

```

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

**1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**
```sql
WITH RANK_CTE AS (SELECT *, 
                        RANK() OVER(ORDER BY total_view DESC) AS RANK_VIEW,
                        RANK() OVER(ORDER BY Total_add DESC) as RANK_ADD,
                        RANK() OVER(ORDER BY purchase_item DESC) as RANK_PURCHASE
                FROM product_stats)

SELECT *
FROM RANK_CTE
WHERE RANK_VIEW =1 
        OR RANK_ADD = 1
        OR RANK_PURCHASE = 1
```

**2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?**

```sql
SELECT top 1 page_name,
        product_category,
        abadoned_item 
FROM product_stats 
ORDER BY abadoned_item DESC;
```

**3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?**

```sql
SELECT  top 1 page_name,
        product_category,
        total_view,
        purchase_item,
        100*( cast(purchase_item as float)/ total_view) as percent_purchase
FROM product_stats 
ORDER BY percent_purchase DESC ;
```

- Lobster has the highest view to purchase percentage 

**4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?**

**5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?**

```sql
SELECT  ROUND(avg(100*( cast(total_add as float)/ total_view)),2) as rate_view_add,
        ROUND(avg(100*( cast(purchase_item as float)/ total_add)),2) as rate_add_purchase
FROM product_stats 
```

- Average views to cart adds rate is 60.95% and average cart adds to purchases rate is 75.93%.
